How to Run the Programs
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/xJam-byte/ads_assignment_1.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd java-algorithms-assignment
Compile and run a specific problem:

javac Problem1_MinimumValue.java
java Problem1_MinimumValue
(Replace Problem1_MinimumValue.java with the desired file name.)

Implemented Problems
Each task has been implemented as a separate Java file.

Problems
1	Find the minimum value in an array	Problem1_MinimumValue.java
2	Compute the average of an array	Problem2_Average.java
3	Check if a number is prime	Problem3_IsPrime.java
4	Compute factorial using recursion	Problem4_Factorial.java
5	Compute Fibonacci numbers	Problem5_Fibonacci.java

Example Run
For Problem1_MinimumValue.java:

Input:
5
3 1 4 1 5

Output:
1
For Problem3_IsPrime.java:

Input:
7

Output:
Prime
